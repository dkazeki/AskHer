                <p id="dos">I know that this upcoming week, our schedules won't align. But of course, I found a way
                    to do this for you hehe.<br>I'm really lucky to have you in my life. From the moment we met, 
                    I knew I could trust you. You're enough for me to share my worries, my fears, and everything 
                    weighing me down. With you, I can be vulnerable. I see you as my safe place. My comfort. There's 
                    no one else who could make me feel at peace as you do. I truly want to love you. I cherish every 
                    memory we've made together, and I want to experience everything with you by my side. Forever.</p><br>
